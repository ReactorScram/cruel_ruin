![](CruelRuin.jpeg)

A downloadable bad idea, named for the party-wiping final boss attack in 
[Golden Sun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Sun).

This is a template / reference for manually binding a Rust library to a C++ executable,
because I keep forgetting the exact CMake and Cargo syntax to use, and how
to pass strings each way.
